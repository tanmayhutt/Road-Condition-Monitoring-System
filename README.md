# Road Surface Monitoring System

## Overview

Road Surface Monitoring Device is a vehicle-mounted embedded sensing and telemetry system designed to detect road anomalies and transmit their locations to a backend server for visualization and analysis.

The system combines:

- STM32F446RE for sensor acquisition and processing
- LSM6DS3 IMU for shock detection
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for road surface measurement
- NEO-6M GPS module for location tracking
- ESP32-S3 for wireless telemetry transmission
- Backend infrastructure for data storage and visualization

The project combines embedded sensing, GPS telemetry, inter-MCU communication, wireless networking, backend infrastructure, and mechanical vehicle integration to create a complete end-to-end road anomaly monitoring platform.

Road events are detected locally on the STM32, enriched with GPS location data, transmitted to an ESP32 gateway, and uploaded to a backend server over Wi-Fi.
